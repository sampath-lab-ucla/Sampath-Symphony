# Sampath Lab - Symphony Related Files

This repo serves as the primary development environment for the definitions used on the various rigs 
in the Sampath Lab at UCLA for the [Symphony DAS](http://symphony-das.github.io).

This repo contains the core, albeit disjointed, for [Conductor](https://github.com/sampath-lab-ucla/Conductor)
as well as a number of protocols, rigs, devices which are currently under development. **We recommend, strongly,
that this repo not be used as-is.** Instead, the repo serves as a catch-all cache for any and all developmental 
changes made to [Conductor](https://github.com/sampath-lab-ucla/Conductor) core and new/updated/modified 
versions of any +protocols and descriptions used in [Symphony V2.x](http://symphony-das.github.io).

*All physiology rigs in the Sampath Lab currently use:*
- Windows 10 Pro (x64)
- MATLAB 2018b (Update 8)
- A [custom Symphony installation](https://github.com/Khlick/symphony-matlab)
- [Conductor](https://github.com/sampath-lab-ucla/Conductor): A Symphony wrapper, user manager and extension framework for Symphony
